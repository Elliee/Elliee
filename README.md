## Hi there, I'm Ellie ðŸ‘‹

**About me**

I am a junior fullstack developer based in Melbourne, Australia :round_pushpin:

My background is in Customer Success/Sales allowed me to be collaborative, adapt to feedback, and understand client requirements - all skills which have been helpful transitioning careers to software development.

I recently completed a 6 month Web Development bootcamp with Le Wagon, where I learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, SQL/Database design, Ruby and Rails. As a final project, my team and I designed and built a Rails app - http://www.learnfromthegroundup.com/ - a web application which enables people to learn a new skill and document their learning journey. 

Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time at the beach :ocean:, travelling :airplane:, and good coffee/food! :coffee:
