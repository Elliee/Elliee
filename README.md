## Hi there, I'm Ellie ðŸ‘‹

**About me**

I'm a software developer based in Melbourne, Australia :round_pushpin:

I decided to make a career change from software sales into software development after learning to code during the pandemic and completing a Web Development bootcamp. I currently work as an Associate Software Engineer at Digio, where I get to work with a variety of different technologies. I enjoy learning, problem solving and collaborating with other people to help develop quality solutions. 

Outside of work I enjoy spendng time outdoors, cooking, reading and travel.
