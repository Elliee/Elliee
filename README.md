## Hi there, I'm Ellie ðŸ‘‹

**About me**

I am a software developer based in Melbourne, Australia :round_pushpin:

I decided to make a career change from software sales into software development after learning to code during the pandemic and completing a Web Development bootcamp. I currently work as an Associate Software Engineer at Digio, where I get to work with a variety of different technologies. I enjoy the creativity and problem solving aspects of software development and learning new topics.

Outside of working, I enjoy spending time at the beach :ocean:, travelling :airplane:, and good coffee + food! :coffee:
